      <description>Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Macosko lab at the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research within the Broad Institute. I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics and Statistics at Boston University supervised by Henry Lam and Eric Kolaczyk where I focused on complexity penalized methods for structured and unstructured data with applications to modeling queueing systems, information retrieval from text documents and network inference. My current research focus is in representation learning for single-cell RNA-seq data and spatial transcriptomics targeting questions in neuroscience.</description>
